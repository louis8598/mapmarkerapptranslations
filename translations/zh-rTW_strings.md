## Translation Key: compass_calibration_help_part_1
```
In order to get the proper north direction for the compass, you need to calibrate you device properly.
To calibrate your device, simply move it around by drawing a 8. The move must be wide and repeated about 3 times for better efficiency.
You can calibrate you device by doing this at any time.
```
translated (by human 👀) as:
```
為了得到正確指南針方向，你需要正確校正你的手機。只需透過8字形移動並重複3次左右。您可以在任何時候做該動作校正你的手機。
```


## Translation Key: compass_calibration_help_part_2
```
The calibration has its limitations and might not be enough to counter nearby interferences such as :
• big metal objects
• electronic devices
• magnets
• the inside of a car/bus/train/plane
```
translated (by human 👀) as:
```
校正有其局限性，可能是不足以抵銷附近的干擾，如：大型金屬物體、電子設備、磁鐵、位於汽車/巴士/火車/飛機內部

Hey, thank you for your curiosity!

I used to have an ad banner here and I decided to try something different and replace it with this simple message…

I made this app on my free time as a hobby, additionally to having a full time job, and it turns out it became a side project on which I have spent a lot of time for over 4 years now.

I hope you like the app and find it useful. I made it in a way that you can still do everything without paying, it might just take a little bit more work. You are free to import or export the data manually, so you never really have to pay, it's just that cloud sync is more convenient.

If you like the app, please support it: you don't have to spend money for that, any of those gestures helps:
- talk about the app to people around you
- rate the app to recommend it on the store
- purchase the premium upgrade (will remove the bottom banner)

If you do not like the app, please email me (from the "about" section) and let me know how I can improve it. I've come this far thanks to the feedback of many users who told me about what they missed or didn't like, and I reply to every single email, so don't be shy!

And finally, thank you for reading this :-)

Regards
Sébastien

嘿，謝謝你的好奇心！ 
 
我以前在這裡放了一個廣告橫幅，我決定嘗試不同的東西，並用這個簡單的消息替換它... 
 
我利用業餘時間製作了這個應用程序，事實上我還有一份正職工作，實際上它已經成為一個我花了超過4年時間的副項目。 
 
我希望您喜歡該應用程序並發現它有用。您仍然可以無償使用任何功能，只是需要更多的步驟。您可以自由地手動匯入或匯出數據，因此您無需支付任何費用，只是利用有雲端同步更加方便。
 
如果您喜歡該應用程序，請支持它：您不必花錢，以下任何方式都有幫助： 
 - 向您周圍的人談論本應用程序
 - 評價應用程序並在商店上推薦它
 - 購買高級升級（將刪除底部橫幅） 
 
如果您不喜歡該應用程序，請email me （來自“關於”部分）讓我知道如何改進它。我已經走到這一步了，感謝許多用戶的反饋，他們告訴我，他們缺少或不喜歡什麼，我會回覆每一個email ，所以不要害羞！ 
 
最後，感謝您的閱讀:-) 
 
致上我最高的問候
塞巴斯蒂安

The default search experience is not optimal, but it works without configuration.

If you use search a lot, it is strongly recommended to configure a third party search source to benefit from better search results.

It should only take a little bit of your time and will allow you to benefit from much better search results for free.

Click the "Change source" button and then the "Tutorial" option to learn more.
```

默認搜索體驗不是最佳，但無需設置即可運行。

如果您經常使用搜索，強烈建議您配置第三方搜索來源，以便從更好的搜索結果中受益。

它應該只花一點時間，讓您免費獲得更好的搜索結果。
